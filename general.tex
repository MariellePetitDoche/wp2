This document is a description of work for WP2 T2. ``Definition of the
Methodology''.

We will first give an overview of the general development process and the main
requirements according to CENELEC EN 50128~\cite{EN-50128} and then propose an
instantiation thereof for openETCS. The focus of this instantiation is the
increased usage of formal methods to augment the quality and to replace some of
the manual tasks with formal approaches.
