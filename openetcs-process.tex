The development process for openETCS shall closely follow the V-Model process
presented in CENELEC EN 50128 Figure~4. It is separated into different distinct phases
which allow for iteration in the phases and between the phases. The
participating roles in the software development process are defined in CENELEC
EN 50128 Figure~2.

\subsection{Participating Roles}
\label{sec:participating-roles}

Each of the participants must be noted and her name and role recorded. Which
role can be taken by the same person is regulated as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:preferred-roles}.

\subsubsection{Requirements Maganger (RQM)}
\label{sec:requ-magang-rqm}

The main task of the RQM is to take care of the software requirements. She will
specify the software requirements, ensure their traceability wrt. system level
requirements and ensure the consistency of the SW requirement specification.

In the openETCS project, the RQM will in particular ensure the consistency,
correctness and validity of the SW requirements wrt. system requirement
specification.

\subsubsection{Designer (DES)}
\label{sec:designer}

The main task of the DES is to create acceptable solutions from the SW
requirement specifications. She is responsible for the decisions which design
methods to apply and which tools to use. The DES develops the software component
specifications and ensures their traceability and consistency wrt. SW
requirements specification.

In openETCS the DES will be responsible to specify the components and to ensure
the consistency, correctness and traceability of the component specification
wrt. the SW requirements specification.

\subsubsection{Implementer (IMP)}
\label{sec:implementer}

\subsubsection{Tester (TST)}
\label{sec:tester}

\subsubsection{Verifier (VER)}
\label{sec:verifier}

\subsubsection{Integrator (INT)}
\label{sec:integrator}

\subsubsection{Validator (VAL)}
\label{sec:validator}

\subsubsection{Assessor (ASR)}
\label{sec:assessor}

\subsubsection{Project Manager (PM)}
\label{sec:project-manager}

\subsubsection{Configuration Manager}
\label{sec:conf-manag}


\subsection{Lifecycle Phases}
\label{sec:lifecycle-phases}

The general model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:develop-lifecycle-cenelec}, it
consists of the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
\item System Development Phase
\item SW Development Phases
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SW Requirements Phase
  \item SW Architecture and Design Phase
  \item SW Component Design Phase
  \end{itemize}
\item SW Component Implementation Phase
\item SW Test / Validation Phases
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SW Validation Phase
  \item SW Integration Phase
  \item SW Component Testing Phase
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each of the SW development phases shall have an analogous test / validation
phase.
